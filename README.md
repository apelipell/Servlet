# Servlet

Statisfy is an Android application showing Spotify statistics (almost). Super cool!

The application is made for spotify users to be able to get their own top artist, songs and genres that has been played during long, medium or short term periods. The application is however only in making, the first version is only a test using placeholders taken from premade users.
This is the servlet that will connect the application to the information currently provided via the database statistics.db. In a future version this will be replaced by the actual Spotify API.

## For developers
